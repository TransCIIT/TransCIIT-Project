â”œâ”€â”€ __mocks__                       # Mocks for testing
â”œâ”€â”€ .github                         # GitHub folder
â”œâ”€â”€ .husky                          # Husky configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ .vscode                         # VSCode configuration
â”œâ”€â”€ public                          # Public assets folder
â”œâ”€â”€ src
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts                     # Layouts components
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages                       # Next JS Pages
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages.test                  # Next JS Pages tests (this avoid test to treated as a Next.js pages)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles                      # Styles folder
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ templates                   # Default template
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ utils                       # Utility functions
â”œâ”€â”€ tailwind.config.js              # Tailwind CSS configuration
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json                   # TypeScript configuration
```

### Customization

To easily configure check:

- `public/apple-touch-icon.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon-16x16.png` and `public/favicon-32x32.png`: your website favicon, you can generate from https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- `src/styles/global.css`: your CSS file using Tailwind CSS
- `src/utils/AppConfig.ts`: configuration file
- `src/templates/Main.tsx`: default theme

### Deploy to production

You can see the results locally in production mode with:

```shell
$ npm run build
$ npm run start
```

The generated HTML and CSS files are minified (built-in feature from Next js). It will also removed unused CSS from [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com).

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build-prod
```

All generated files are located at `out` folder, which you can deploy to vercel.

### Testing

All tests are colocated with the source code inside the same directory. So, it makes it easier to find them. Unfortunately, it is not possible with the `pages` folder which is used by Next.js for routing. So, what is why we have a `pages.test` folder to write tests from files located in `pages` folder.


### Deploy to Vercel

Deploy this Project on Vercel in one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com)

### VSCode information (optional)

If you are VSCode users, you can have a better integration with VSCode by installing the suggested extension in `.vscode/extension.json`. The starter code comes up with Settings for a seamless integration with VSCode. The Debug configuration is also provided for frontend and backend debugging experience.

With the plugins installed on your VSCode, ESLint and Prettier can automatically fix the code and show you the errors. Same goes for testing, you can install VSCode Jest extension to automatically run your tests and it also show the code coverage in context.

Pro tips: if you need a project wide type checking with TypeScript, you can run a build with <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Mac.

### Logging

Logging is done by axiom for production

### Sentry
