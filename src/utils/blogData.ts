  'We at Jaramogi Oginga Odinga University of Science and Technology (JOOUST) are excited to have been selected to pilot this noble project on how to implement a matchmaking service between\nthe various and evolving business needs of young climate entrepreneurs and the specialist skills of\nmaster\u2019s students through the Transforming Climate Innovation Ecosystems through Inclusive\nTransdisciplinarity (TransCIIT) project. Indeed, the partnership between the young climate\nentrepreneurs and university students is instrumental to advancing research and knowledge and\nimparting skills among the workforce in these businesses. This collaboration is certainly a catalyst to\ninnovation and growth in climate innovation ecosystems. Universities are known to contribute to the\ntheory while the industry is constrained by profit. As a result, universities and the industry run parallel\nto each other. Therefore, creating partnership between the two has the potential to contribute to the\nbetterment of both the industry and universities.\nTransCIIT project provides an opportunity of the much needed collaboration between universities\nand industry. This project seeks to pilot a service in Kenya that matches the needs of climate\nentrepreneurs with the skills of master\u2019s students, thereby exploring how to develop and strengthen\nuniversity-industry linkage and contribute to building innovation systems that can nurture\ntransformative change. The project is implementing a tangible response to the need for\nunderstanding what role universities could play in establishing strong relations in the climate\ninnovation ecosystem (CIE).\nTransCIIT brought together eight entrepreneurs with business focus ranging from packaging,\nproduction of organic fertilizer, sustainable waste management, and many more. Jaramogi Oginga\nOdinga University of Science and Technology (JOOUST) in Kenya is privileged to have been\nselected to pilot this program. In this project, entrepreneurs identify their business needs which is\nshared with masters students from different disciplines but with specific expertise that match the\nbusiness need of the entrepreneurs. Among the business needs identified by the entrepreneurs\nwere customer mapping, branding, drawing strategic marketing plan, providing technical assistance\n\nand capacity development, developing business models, web marketing and digital advertising.\nWe adopted a transdisciplinary approach and inclusivity in the selection of master students at\nJOOUST. Recruitment of masters students in the project was done competitively and with due\nconsideration of gender and persons with disability. This was an open call with information shared\nwidely with the respective heads of different departments in different schools and on the social\nmedia platforms. Deans of four schools responded with names of students who met the\nrequirements. Students from the following schools submitted their information to the JOOUST\nrepresentative: School of Informatics and Innovative Systems, School of Business and Economics,\nSchool of Biological, Physical, Mathematics and Actuarial Sciences and School of Agricultural and\nFood Sciences. TransCIIT organized for several virtual meetings to bring together the entrepreneurs,\nstudents, and the team comprising of members from African Centre for Technology Studies (ACTS),\n\nTransforming Climate Innovation Ecosystems through Inclusive Transdisciplinarity (TransCIIT) project\nKenya Climate Innovation Center (KCIC), University of Johannesburg (UJ), and the Science Policy\nResearch Unit (SPRU) at the University of Sussex in the UK.\nDespite the challenges of conducting online matchmaking event the team developed strategy that\nworked so well. The online matchmaking event began with an introduction of the team members,\nentrepreneurs, and the students present. The activity was broken into two sessions. During session\n1, eight breakout rooms were organized and designated by business name. Each entrepreneur was\njoined to the room with their business name and the students were added to each room according to\nthe pre-matched list. Meanwhile, the TransCIIT team were on standby to provide assistance when\nneeded. During session 2, the students whose expertise matched the needs of the entrepreneurs\nwere allowed to continue their conversations with their matched entrepreneur. However, the\nstudents who did not have a match were swapped to another room to look for potential matches as\nthe TransCIIT team provided assistance when needed. At the end of the session all the eight\nstudents found a potential match among the entrepreneurs.\nThe next phase required the students and the entrepreneurs to develop a work plan to be submitted\nto one of the TransCIIT team members for close monitoring of the matched project\u2019s progress. This\nwas done in order to ensure that the stated business needs of the entrepreneurs and the opportunity\nfor each master\u2019s student were met. The matchmaking event was indeed successful with eight\nmasters students from different disciplines and gender finding a match with different entrepreneurs.';
